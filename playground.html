## New syntax playground

### Page variables

Really these are more like constants, and you use `set` to define them.
Their values are available only inside the file where you `set` them.

```html
<!-- set test -->
<!-- set message Hello World! -->
```

### Default variables

You can set global default values for variables with `default`. If
you use `set` with the same variable name in a given file, the default
value will be overwritten inside that file (and return to its default
value for other files).

```html
<!-- default development -->
<!-- default title My Website -->
```

### Conditional builds

You can test a variable to decide if you want to include or exclude
a section. These will work inside snippets as well.

```html
<!-- if test -->
test is truthy!<br>
<!-- endif -->

<!-- if !test -->
test is falsy!<br>
<!-- endif -->
```

### Snippets

Snippets work like commone clipboard, using `cut`, `copy` and `paste` to
define and use snippets. Both `cut` and `copy` make snippets. The
difference is `copy` will copy the snippet while, you guessed it, 
`cut` will cut it out of the current file. When in doubt, use `copy`.

```html
<!-- copy nav -->
<p>
	Nav: A, B, C<br>
	(will show up twice because we copied it)
</p>
<!-- end -->

<!-- cut footer -->
<p>
	Copyright &copy; 2016 A, B, C<br>
	(only shows up once because we cut it)
</p>
<!-- end -->

<!-- paste footer -->
<!-- paste nav -->
```

### Insert other content files

Right now, **snipmake** copies the file contents verbatum. Later there may
be filters (eg. markdown, jade).

```html
<!-- paste from metatags.html -->
```
